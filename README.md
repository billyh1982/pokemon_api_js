Objective:
In this assignment, you will demonstrate your understanding of JavaScript Objects, the DOM, and asynchronous JavaScript by creating a simple web page that interacts with the PokeAPI to display basic Pokémon information. 
This exercise will help you practice fetching data from an API and dynamically updating the webpage.Instructions:
1. 
Create an input box where users can type the name or ID of a Pokémon.
Add a button that triggers the search when clicked.
Use the PokeAPI to fetch Pokémon data asynchronously.
When the search is triggered, make an API request to retrieve the Pokémon's information.
3. Display Data:
Display the Pokémon's name and image on the page after fetching the data.
Update the DOM dynamically based on the API response.
4. Basic Error Handling:
If the Pokémon is not found, display a simple error message.
Bonus (Optional):
Display the Pokémon's type (e.g., Fire, Water) along with its name and image.
Technical Requirements:
Use vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks).
Fetch Pokémon data using the Fetch API or async/await.
Dynamically update the DOM with the Pokémon data.
Deliverables:
A working web page that allows users to search for a Pokémon and displays its name and image.
Evaluation Criteria:
The app should successfully fetch and display Pokémon data.
Clean and readable code.
Simple, functional interface with appropriate feedback for invalid searches.
